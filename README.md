# Arduino Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) Demonstration
This simple project demonstrates how to use the Arduino Uno to convert an analog signal into a digital value and display the result on the Arduino IDE's serial monitor. The analog input is generated by a circuit with a potentiometer, allowing the user to manually adjust the analog value and observe the variations in real-time on the serial monitor.

## 📋 Project Description
### 📌 Objective
The goal is to read an analog value from the A0 pin of the Arduino Uno, convert it into a digital value using the built-in ADC, and display the reading on the Arduino IDE serial monitor.

### 📌 How It Works
A potentiometer is connected to the A0 pin, generating an analog input signal.
The Arduino reads this value using the analogRead() function.
The read value is scaled to a range of 0 to 5V (based on the Arduino Uno's reference voltage) and displayed on the serial monitor as the corresponding voltage variation.
If the user changes the potentiometer's resistance, the value displayed on the serial monitor dynamically updates.
## 🧰 Components Used
1 Arduino Uno
1 Potentiometer
Jumper wires
USB power supply for the Arduino
## ⚡ Arduino Uno Capabilities
The Arduino Uno features an ATmega328P microcontroller with a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This means it can divide the 0–5V range into 1024 distinct levels (from 0 to 1023), enabling precise analog value readings.

### 🧪 Technical Details of the Conversion
The analogRead() function returns an integer value between 0 and 1023.
Each increment of 1 unit corresponds to a variation of approximately 4.9 mV (

5V/1023).
This conversion is sufficient for many monitoring and control applications in electronics and automation projects.
## 💻 How to Use
Connect the potentiometer to the Arduino:
The potentiometer's middle pin to A0.
One external terminal to GND.
The other external terminal to 5V.
Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Open the serial monitor in the IDE to view the voltage values in real-time.
Adjust the potentiometer and observe the displayed variations.
## 🚀 Possible Extensions
Add an LCD display to show the values directly.
Use an LED to visually demonstrate changes in the analog input.
Implement a data logging system to store readings on an SD card.
